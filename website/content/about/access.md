# Requesting access to MIMIC-CXR

MIMIC-CXR contains information regarding the clinical care of ICU patients, so it must be treated with appropriate care and respect.

# Requesting access to DICOM images and radiology reports

DICOM images and radiology reports are currently not publicly available, but plans are underway for their release. In order to access the images and reports, researchers must be credentialed. The credentialing process involves completion of a training course and signing of a data use agreement, described in more detail below. Note that this is the same process as is used for [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org) and [eICU-CRD](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu); if you already have access to these databases you do not need to reapply, though you may need to sign the data use agreement once more.

### Complete the required training course

Prior to requesting access to the eICU Collaborative Research Database, you will need to complete the CITI “Data or Specimens Only Research” course:

- First register on the CITI program website, selecting “Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates” as your organization affiliation: https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=154&icat=0&ac=0
- Follow the links to add a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates course. In the Human Subjects training category, select the “Data or Specimens Only Research” course
- Complete the course and save a copy of your certificate.

### Request access:

- Create an account on PhysioNet using the following link: https://physionet.org/pnw/login. If you already have a PhysioNetWorks account, [log in to it](https://physionet.org/pnw/login).
- Follow the instructions on PhysioNet to apply for access to the MIMIC-CXR project, remembering to provide your CITI training certificate: https://physionet.org/works/MIMICCXR/access.shtml
- When your application has been approved you will receive emails containing instructions for downloading the database from PhysioNetWorks. Approval may take several business days, and will be delayed if your request is missing any required information.
