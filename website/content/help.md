# Help and support

MIMIC-CXR is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, Philips Healthcare, and [our collaborators](/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide.

We therefore encourage MIMIC-CXR users to work together as a community. We have created a [MIMIC-CXR repository](https://github.com/mit-lcp/mimic-cxr) where users can:

* ask questions in a public forum so all members of the community can benefit from the answers
* contribute code to accelerate research
* share insight into the data and its analysis

## How can I get help with my analysis?

If you are seeking advice for a specific question, we would suggest raising an issue on the [MIMIC-CXR repository](https://github.com/mit-lcp/mimic-cxr).

## How do I raise an issue on the MIMIC-CXR Repository?

To raise an issue, first navigate to the [MIMIC-CXR repository issues page](https://github.com/mit-lcp/mimic-cxr/issues). After logging in to GitHub, click "New issue", add a title and description of the problem, and then select the "Submit new issue" button.
